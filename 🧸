i often pause for brief moments in my day
when i see a nook or cubby
i'm taken back to the days where
i could flip over a chair and hide under it
and feel so safe
there's something about adolescence 
that points a sort of magic at the corners and alcoves
overlooked once you enter adulthood
maybe we loved making hiding spaces as children
because it was our first experience 
of sheltering off our "own" parts of the world
it would be where we could discover who we are
maybe i still notice these places so often today
because i still have much to learn about myself
and my place in this world.
